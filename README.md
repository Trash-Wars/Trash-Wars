### Conflict Plan
- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises? Discuss conflict, come to a solution between the two parties. If there is an issue that cannot be resolved between the two team members, the issues will be brought to a team as a whole. 
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? Jimcoin assets will be withheld. The team will convene to discuss the issue with the offending member. 
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? We will come to one another respectfully, taking the time to teach the person if we have it. 
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?  If a member is not contributing their fair share, the group will inform them they need to step it up.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? If there is no possible way to resolve the issue ourselves, and the issue is a core part of the project, we will attempt to bring in a third party either the instructor or ideally a member of the other team to act as a neutral arbitrator.

## Prep 2
  
### Trash Wars
  1. Game is an auto battler, in which hardy racoons are fighting to defend their home... an enormous heap of trash from various types of baddies.
  2. This app will solve the common pain point that everyone has experienced, a totally overwhelming boredom. If it can be properly implemented on react native, it will gameify exercise so that the more a user moves, the more rewards they would get in the game. 
  3. MVP
    - Game board w/ assets
    - Pieces should be dynamic
    - Logic for game mechanics is handled on frontEnd
